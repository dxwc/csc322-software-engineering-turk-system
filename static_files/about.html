    <h1>Coding Turk system</h1>

<p>
    "In this system, registered users can be either a client who posts
    system request or a developer who implements the system(s) a client
    posted. A super-user handles user accounts, money related issues
    and proctor user activities."
</p>

"
<ol>
    <li>
        Visitors can browse and search public information made available by
        clients and developers 
    </li>
    <li>
        A visitor can apply to be a client or developer with deposited
        money and basic information, a temporary account with
        applicant’s own choice of user id and password is provided—the
        system should check and assure the uniqueness of the user id. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The super-user will check the credentials of user applications
        and decide to accept or reject applicants, applicants in black
        list will be rejected automatically, for any rejected cases the
        super-user must write one sentence describing the reason.
    </li>
    <li>
        For rejected applicant, when s/he tries to login with the
        temporary account, s/he will be blocked with reason why s/he
        was rejected; for accepted applicant, s/he will be shown a
        welcome screen and asked to fill in more details about
        her/himself, such as a resume, picture, interests, sample work
        (for developer) and business credential (for client), interest,
        etc., which are available for others to browse
    </li>
    <li>
        A client can post a system demand: including a paragraph
        describing the system spec and bidding timeline; a developer
        can bid on any demand with promised timeline and money. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The client can choose which bidding developer to hire, if the
        bidder is not of the lowest price, the client should provide
        justifications; once confirmed, half of the bidding price will
        be transferred from the client to the winning developer as the
        front. The developer is required to deliver the system before
        the posted deadline: if not, the front money and a fixed
        penalty will be transferred from the developer back to the
        client, and the developer will also receive an automatic rating
        1 (worst). If the developer delivered the system before or on
        the deadline, the remaining half of the price is transferred to
        the super-user automatically. The client is asked to evaluate
        the delivered system with ratings from 1 to 5, 1 being worst, 5
        being the best. If the rating is &gt;=3, the money held by
        super-user account is automatically transferred to the
        developer; otherwise, the client should write one note
        describing why the rating is so low, the super-user will
        discuss with client and developer to decide how much money to
        give to the developer and back to client. The “discussion” here
        is off-line without your work: super-user makes the final
        decision with justifications to change or leave the low rating
        as is. If there is no bidder at the posted deadline, the
        project is removed automatically and the client is charged $10.
    </li>
    <li>
        For every finished transaction, the system will charge 5%,
        money transferred to super-user’s account, from both the
        involved client and developer.
    </li>
    <li>
        The developer can also rate the client after finishing the
        transaction from 1 to 5, a paragraph must be provided for a
        rating &lt;=2. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Any developer or client who received average rating is &lt;=2 for
        &gt;=5 projects is warned due to poor performance; any user whose
        average rating to others is &lt;2 (too low) or &gt;4 for &gt;=8 (too
        high) project is also warned for irresponsible evaluations.
        Warned users can send protesting message to the super-user, and
        the super-user can keep or remove the warning. Any user who is
        warned twice is thrown out of the system: s/he can login for
        one last time for system closing matters then the account is
        closed forever. The user can still protest for super-user to
        reverse this action. All thrown-out users will be put in a
        black list who cannot register in the next one year. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The whole history of any client and developer, including
        ratings and project details, is publicly available
    </li>
